"""This module provide different kinds of spiders for crawling processes.

There three kinds of crawling processes:
    (1) Fetch URL. Spiders are:
        a. FeedSpider (update),
        b. PageSpider(update),
        c. SitemapSpider(archive),
        d. PageTemplateSpider(archive),
        e. SiteSpider(archive)
    (2) Fetch HTML. Spider is HtmlSpider
    (3) Parse article. Spider is ArticleParserSpider

The intention of parameter `url_regex` is try to filter out non-article url.
However it was too hard to determine the pattern. Also we also collect URLs
from twitter, which is not filtered out. Thus `url_regex` is just a placeholder
right now, no function.

It takes very long time to crawl the entire site to collect all archieve
article. If the articles are list in a page template (most wordpress powered
site own this pattern), you can use PageTemplateSpider. This Spider is much
preciser (in terms of article) and faster.
